 OOP Game Show

The OOP Game Show allows the user to engage in a less morbid iteration of "Hangman," gently losing one of five tries (symbolized as blue hearts) per missed guess rather than illustrate an unfortunate stickman.  The keyboard displays the correct/incorrect keys as the user selects their input which is accomplished by either clicking the desired letter on screen, or typing it on their own phsycial keyboard via "click" or "keyup" eventListeners.
